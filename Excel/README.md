## üìä Data Cleaning & Visualisation in Excel  

This project showcases my ability to **clean, format, analyse, and visualise data in Excel**. The two files highlight different skill sets, from formatting data using Excel functions to creating Pivot tables and charts.   

You can access and download the files directly on GitHub (recommended for better interactivity) or view the cloud-hosted versions via OneDrive using the links below.
