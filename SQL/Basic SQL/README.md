# ðŸš¢ Basic SQL Queries for Cruise Company Database  

This project showcases my ability to **design, manipulate, and analyse relational databases using SQL**. I have built a **cruise company database**, populated the tables with sample data, and executed various queries to extract insights.  

## ðŸ“Œ Key SQL Skills Demonstrated  
âœ… **Database Design & Management** â€“ Creating and modifying tables  
âœ… **Data Manipulation** â€“ Inserting, updating, and deleting records  
âœ… **Data Retrieval & Analysis** â€“ Using complex queries for insights  
âœ… **Aggregations** â€“ Summarising and refining data  
âœ… **Date & Time Functions** â€“ Handling time-based data

## ðŸ“‚ 1.Tables  
This SQL script includes a **fully structured database** with key SQL commands:  
- **Data Definition (DDL):** `CREATE TABLE`  
- **Data Manipulation (DML):** `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

### ðŸ”Ž 2.Queries
The SQL queries in this script focus on **extracting, aggregating, and analysing** data. Key concepts include:  
- **SELECT statements**
- **Subqueries**
- **Complex JOINs:** `LEFT JOIN`/`RIGHT JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`, `multiple JOINs`
- **Data Aggregations:** `AVG`, `MAX`, `COUNT`, `ROUND`, `CEILING`
- **Date & Time Functions:** `YEAR`, `QUARTER`, `DATE_DIFF`, `CUR_DATE`, `TIME`
