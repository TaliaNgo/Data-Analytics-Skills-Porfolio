## Basic SQL Queries
This project aims to implement basic SQL queries. For this scenario, I have created a database for a cruise company, populated the tables and performed queries to retrieve data.  

### 1.Tables
This SQL script contains the code that creates the database, including:   
- CREATE
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

### 2.Queries
This SQL script contains the queries for data retrieval. The SQL syntax used include:   
- SELECT statements
- SUBQUERY
- JOINs: LEFT/RIGHT JOIN, INNER JOIN
- AGGREGATIONS: AVG, MAX, COUNT, ROUND, CEILING
- DATETIME: YEAR, QUARTER, DATE_DIFF, CUR_DATE, TIME
